## Overview

This system is designed for food producers and nutrition-focused businesses to manage the full cycle of personalized meal planning â€” from ingredients to order fulfillment. It allows producers to create meals, build weekly menus, assign them to customers, and automate order generation for weekly deliveries.

## Key Features

- **Ingredient Management**  
  Add, update, or remove ingredients with nutritional data. AI-assisted ingredient creation is supported. Changes automatically update related meals.
